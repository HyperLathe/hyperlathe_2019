        <h3>UX/UI designer / front-end designer & developer</h3>
        <p>Hello! Welcome to my online portfolio, where you can see some examples of my design and development work.</p>
        <p>I have been creating web-related content since 2004, including wireframing, UX, prototyping, design, development, and testing.</p>
        <p>I am a huge fan of responsive design, accessibility, and clean, semantic markup, and have enjoyed working in a number of industries including e-commerce, finance, communications, and insurance.</p>
        <p>Prior to my current career path, I worked as a composer and copywriter; both of which I found to be useful methodologies in regard to what I'm doing today.</p>
        <p>Feel free to contact me or call on +44 (0)7967 639 192 if you would like to discuss working together..</p>
